<p>To prepare myself for high school, I have recently started to read AP (Advanced placement) books. I decided that it would be a good idea to summarize what I have learned on my website. This is a good way to reinforce my learning because it is essentially asking me: “What have I learned at the end of the day?”, and being able to put things into your own words is a good way to show understanding. The AP book I will be summarizing is U.S. History, 1.2</p>
<p><img src="/images/AP.jpg" alt="books"></p>
<p>The large societies of the Native Americans can be split into four smaller categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Societies of the Southwest</li>
<li>Societies of the Great Basin</li>
<li>Societies of the East</li>
<li>Societies of the Pacific Northwest</li>
</ul>
<p>The AP curriculum focuses on the pueblo people when it comes to the societies of the Southwest. They lived in areas that are part of the current southwestern United States. They got their name of pueblo from the Spanish because many lived in pueblos which translates to small towns. The ancestral Pueblo cuulture developed around the year 900 in the <strong>Four Corners</strong> region of the Southwest: where Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico meet. Sometimes called <strong>Anasazi</strong> people, these early Pueblos are very reliant on the agriculture of maize (corn), which also goes for all people of the Southwest Native Americans. However, in the 13th and 14th century, various factors such as volcanic eruptions and droughts caused by climate change forced them to abandon their settlements near the Four Corners region. The neighboring tribes, thinking that the Pueblo people were trying to invade them, became wary and caused conflicts. This caused the Pueblo people to throw away everything they had and to join the other groups. If you can’t beat them, join them. </p>

<p>Next, we have the societies of the Great Basin. But first, what is the Great Basin? It refers to the 400,000 square mile area between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The area’s environment is diverse, but it has a lack of natural resources. Around 5,000 years ago, a rise in temperature caused hot conditions which led to droughts that struck the American West from 900 to 1400. Most Great Basin tribes share nomad lifestyles, searching and foraging for food throughout the year. These groups of people often developed basket-making, whereas more sedentary groups often developed pottery. The large groupings of tribes of the Great Basin are the Shoshone, Paiute and the Utah People. </p>
<p><img src="/images/basin.png" alt="bigbasin"></p>
<p>The <strong>Plains Indians</strong> are the native groups most commonly stereotyped in images of Indians. These stereotypes often describe them as riding horses, wearing feathered headdresses and hunting buffalos. Mobile groups like the <strong>Arapaho</strong>, the <strong>Blackfoot</strong>, the <strong>Sioux</strong> and the <strong>Cheyenne</strong> hunted on foot, groups closer to the Mississipi river tend to be more sedentary and agarian. Sedentary means sitting down and not doing much, agrarian means the cultivation of land. Some of these tribes include the <strong>Omaha</strong>, the <strong>Wichita</strong> and the <strong>Osage</strong>. </p>
<p>Next, onto the Societies of the East, we have the Algonquian peoples and the Iroquois Great Leagues of Peace. The Atlantic coast Algonquians hunted, fished, and grew corn, whereas Algonquians in northern new England and the upper Great Lakes region had colder climate and were forced to rely on only hunting and fishing. The Iroquois League is a confederation made up of the <strong>Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas</strong>. Later, in 1720, a sixth group, the <strong>Tuscaroras</strong>, joined the league. The Iroquois lived in settled, permanent villages. They lived on farming, gathering, hunting and fishing. However, the majority of their food came from farming. Corn, beans and squash are the most important crops to them, being named the “three sisters” of crops. The Iroquois are traditionally a matrilineal society, which means inheritance and descent pass through the mother’s line. </p>
<p>Lastly, the book also covered the Chinook people. They lived along the Columbia River in present-day Washington and Oregon. The Chinook people practiced foraging, hunting and fishing and tend to live in settled communities. The higher class people such as the shamans, warriors and successful merchants lived away from the commoners. The commoners themselves mostly lived in longhouses which can contain up to fifty people.</p>
